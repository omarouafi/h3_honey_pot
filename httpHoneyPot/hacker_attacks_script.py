hacker_attacks_script.py
========================

This script simulates an automated hacker attack against the Flask login application.
It sends multiple login requests rapidly to the login endpoint. If a redirect is detected,
the script assumes that the server has redirected to the honeypot (fake login page)
and continues to send login attempts to that URL.

Key Features:
  - Sends rapid POST requests to the login endpoint.
  - Detects redirection via the "Location" header.
  - Constructs a full URL for the redirect if necessary.
  - Simulates further attack attempts on the redirected (honeypot) page.
  - Introduces a short delay between each attempt to mimic bot-like behavior.
